# Choreographic Interfaces

The choreographic interfaces repo contains code for installing and running diferrent versions and applications (related projects and installations) of the choreographic interface (CI) on Mac or Windows OS (currently configured for Mac). 

**Repo Contents**
 - **code-archive** - the code archive contains past iterations and prototypes of CI.
 - **ci-utils** - ci utils contains utility code, specifically several google colabs used to generate pose classes and classifiers that are necessary as inputs to the current working version of CI.
 - **curatorial-a(i)gents** - installation scripts and CI code for the Curatorial A(i)gents project, an exhibition curated by metaLAB (at) Harvard.
 - **data-sensorium** - installation scripts and CI code for Data Sensorium, a performance piece developed for the Harvard Art Labs (@Lins maybe add a better description here)
