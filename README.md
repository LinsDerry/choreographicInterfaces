# choreographicInterfaces
By Lins Derry and Jordan Kruguer

The curatorial-a(i)gents folder contains the code for installing and running the choreographic interface (CI) on a Mac or Windows OS (currently configured for Mac). Curatorial A(i)gents was an exhibition curated by metaLAB (at) Harvard. Half of the screen-based projects relied on the following interactions for which the CI accomplishes through gesture recognition: zoom in/out, scroll up/down, advance right/left, select, span, switch hands, and refresh (see image below).
